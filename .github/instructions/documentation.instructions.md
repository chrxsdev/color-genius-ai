## Documentation Instructions

When updating or adding new features to the codebase, it's essential to keep the documentation up-to-date to ensure clarity and ease of use for future developers. Please follow these guidelines when making changes:

1. **Always add documentation in the docs/ directory**: Any new documentation or updates after completing a task, add to existing documentation placed in the docs/ directory of the project. This helps keep all documentation organized and easily accessible.
